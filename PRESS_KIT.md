## 📝 Short Description (50 words)

## 📖 Full Description (200 words)

In 1997, eJay revolutionized music creation by letting anyone compose tracks through simple drag-and-drop. Millions of bedroom producers got their start with this accessible approach to music making.

Today, **DeejAI** carries that mission forward — reimagined for 2025.

While traditional DAWs force creativity into 16-step grids, DeejAI introduces the **Linear Flow Engine**: a revolutionary approach where beats are glowing orbs you can place anywhere on a timeline. Drag them, stack them, express yourself through velocity — all without musical training.

Created by **Jimmy Andersson** and **Frida Stålberg** at **BeYourIdolAI**, DeejAI is more than software. It's a statement: music creation should be accessible to everyone, regardless of experience or ability.

**Key Features:**
- 🌊 Linear Flow — No grid restrictions
- 🎚️ Multi-track layers — Organize your creativity
- 🎯 Velocity control — Express dynamics through touch
- 📱 Works everywhere — Browser-based, mobile-friendly
- 💜 Mental health aware — Music as emotional expression

**Our Philosophy:** *Flow Over Form*

Where eJay built loops, DeejAI builds feelings.

*Swedish startup BeYourIdolAI introduces revolutionary "Linear Flow" approach to music creation*

**SWEDEN — January 2025** — BeYourIdolAI today announced the launch of DeejAI, a free music creation platform that carries forward the legacy of eJay — the iconic 1990s software that made music production accessible to millions.
