✨ What is DeejAI?

DeejAI is an emotional music creation platform that breaks free from traditional grid‑based sequencers. Instead of rigid rows and columns, you create music through flow — placing beats as glowing orbs on a timeline, guided by emotion rather than theory.

We're not building another DAW. We're building a bridge between isolated creators — transforming strangers into collaborators, and music into medicine.

🎛️ Three Unique Engines
Engine	Style	Best For
🔲 Classic Grid	Traditional 8×16 sequencer	Learning basics, precise control
💎 Gemini Neon	Enhanced grid with ADSR envelopes	Sound design, texture creation
🌊 Linear Flow	Free‑form timeline with floating orbs	Emotional expression, experimentation
🌊 Linear Flow — Our Revolutionary Approach
