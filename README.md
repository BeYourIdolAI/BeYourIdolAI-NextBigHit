## 🎵 What is DeejAI?

**DeejAI** is a flow-first music creation experience where you place beats as glowing orbs — guided by feel, not rigid grids.

Our thesis:
**AI should not replace artists. AI should make more people creators.**
DeejAI is **Human + AI**: you stay the author, AI acts as a coach.
