## 🌊 What is DeejAI?

**DeejAI** is an emotional music creation platform that breaks free from traditional grid-based sequencers. Inspired by the legendary **eJay** software of the 90s, we've reimagined music creation for a new generation.

> *"Remember eJay? We're bringing back the magic — but without the boxes."*

### The Problem with Traditional DAWs

Most music software forces creativity into rigid 16-step grids. While precise, this approach conflicts with how humans *feel* music emotionally.

### Our Solution: Linear Flow

Instead of clicking squares on a grid, you place **glowing orbs** anywhere on a flowing timeline. These beats can be:

- 🎯 **Moved freely** — drag and drop anywhere
- 🔊 **Stacked** — overlap for layered sounds  
- 🎚️ **Expressed** — velocity based on how you interact
- 🎨 **Organized** — multiple tracks for drums, bass, melody, FX

---

## ✨ Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🌊 **Linear Flow Engine** | Place beats anywhere — no grid restrictions |
| 🎚️ **Multi-Track Layers** | Drums, Bass, Melody, FX — organized chaos |
| 🎯 **Velocity Control** | Press longer = louder. Express yourself! |
| 🔄 **Undo/Redo** | Full history with Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y |
| 🔊 **Overlap System** | Stack sounds for rich, layered audio |
| 🎛️ **Gain Limiter** | No clipping, even with heavy overlaps |
| 📱 **Touch Support** | Works on mobile and tablet |
| 🌐 **No Installation** | Runs in any modern browser |

## 💡 Philosophy

### Flow Over Form

Traditional sequencers demand precision. DeejAI embraces expression.

```
Traditional: [■][■][□][□][■][□][□][■]
DeejAI:      ○    ○  ○      ○    ○○○
             ↑ beats float at any position
```

### Why This Matters

DeejAI is designed to be accessible to everyone:

- **ADHD-friendly** — No rigid structure to follow
- **Anxiety-reducing** — Calming, flowing interface  
- **Beginner-welcoming** — No music theory required
- **Touch-first** — No mouse precision needed

> *"Every beat is a feeling. Every feeling deserves to be heard."*
