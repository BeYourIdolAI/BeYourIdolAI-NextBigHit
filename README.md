## ✨ What is DeejAI?

**DeejAI** is an emotional music creation platform that breaks free from traditional grid-based sequencers. Instead of rigid rows and columns, you create music through **flow** — placing beats as glowing orbs on a timeline, guided by emotion rather than theory.

We're not building another DAW. We're building a **bridge between isolated creators** — transforming strangers into collaborators, and music into medicine.

## 🎛️ Three Unique Engines

| Engine | Style | Best For |
|--------|-------|----------|
| **🔲 Classic Grid** | Traditional 8×16 sequencer | Learning basics, precise control |
| **💎 Gemini Neon** | Enhanced grid with ADSR envelopes | Sound design, texture creation |
| **🌊 Linear Flow** | Free-form timeline with floating orbs | Emotional expression, experimentation |

### 🌊 Linear Flow — Our Revolutionary Approach

> *"Flow Over Form"* — Frida Stålberg, Co-founder

Linear Flow breaks away from rigid musical structures. Instead of snapping to a grid, you:

- **Place beats freely** as glowing orbs on a timeline
- **Express emotion** without music theory knowledge
- **Create intuitively** — if it feels right, it sounds right
